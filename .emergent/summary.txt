<analysis>Here is the summary of the current session:

**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a B2B SaaS application called VeriGuard AI, an anti-fraud platform. The initial request was to replicate a design from Figma. The user later provided an extensive and detailed Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlining the application's vision, features, and target personas: Vendedores (Sellers), Marketplaces, and Bancos (Banks).

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (based on the latest user message):**
- **VeriGuard AI:** A SaaS B2B anti-fraud platform focused on creating Digital Trust through Evidence Packs (immutable digital proof for legal disputes).
- **Three Personas/Dashboards:**
    1.  **Vendedores (Sellers):** Protect digital products, prevent cloning/impersonation, and reduce chargebacks. Features include Product Registration, AI Validation, Security Tests, Audit Mode, and Evidence Pack management.
    2.  **Marketplaces:** Onboard legitimate sellers (KYC), monitor ecosystem health, and filter out fraudsters. Features include Seller Audits, Mass Product Validation, Blacklist Management, Attack Simulations, and AI Training.
    3.  **Bancos (Banks):** Combat money laundering (AML) and secure financial transactions. Features include In-depth Transaction Analysis, Alert History, Regulatory Reporting, and API Integrations.
- **Goal:** The application should serve as a comprehensive demo, visually representing solutions for a long list of specific fraud types provided by the user. The UI should be professional and executive-oriented.
- **Specific UI tasks:**
    - Replace the placeholder logo with a specific .
    - Remove the Central de Ajuda (Help Center) button from the login screen only.
    - Ensure the app works on the preview link and can be deployed to GitHub Pages.

**User's preferred language**: Portuguese

**what currently exists?**
The project is a frontend-only application built with Vite, React, and TypeScript. It has a profile selection screen that leads to three distinct, but static, dashboards for Vendedores, Marketplaces, and Bancos. The agent has fixed initial setup issues, configured TailwindCSS, implemented the logo and UI changes requested by the user, and set up a GitHub Actions workflow for deployment to GitHub Pages. The agent has begun updating the dashboards to align with the detailed PRD, having already pushed code for the Vendedores and Marketplaces dashboards.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working:** The agent was in the process of updating the **Bancos Dashboard** to align with the user's detailed PRD, which includes features for AML, transaction analysis, and regulatory reporting.
*   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
*   **Agent Testing Done:** N
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Frontend testing agent. The agent should use the screenshot tool to visually verify that all three dashboards (Vendedores, Marketplaces, Bancos) have been updated correctly according to the PRD.
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1 (P0):** Complete the UI overhaul for all dashboards based on the user's PRD.

    *   **Issues Detail:**
        *   **Issue 1: Complete Dashboard Updates**
            *   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has already overwritten  and .
            *   **Next debug checklist:**
                1.  Overwrite the file  with the new content reflecting the PRD.
                2.  Run the application to ensure it builds and runs without errors.
                3.  Use the screenshot tool to capture images of all three updated dashboards.
                4.  Verify that the new UI elements (buttons, KPIs, cards) described in the PRD are present on each respective dashboard.
            *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This will complete the user's primary request to make the application a full-featured visual demo of the VeriGuard AI platform.
            *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
            *   **Is recurring issue?** N
            *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
            *   **Blocked on other issue:** None

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1 (P0):** Update Bancos Dashboard
    *   **Where to resume:** The agent needs to generate and write the updated code for the  component.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** The Banks dashboard UI will be updated to include all the specified features like transaction analysis, AML KPIs, reporting buttons, and the compliance card.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend
    *   **Blocked on something:** None

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    *   **(P1) Implement Backend and APIs:** The entire application is currently static. The next major phase will be to build a backend (e.g., FastAPI) to provide data and functionality to the frontend UI.
    *   **(P1) Implement Modal Functionality:** The modals for actions like Cadastrar Produto exist as UI shells. They need to be made functional.
    *   **(P2) Implement Dark Mode:** Add a toggle for switching between light and dark themes.
*   **Future Tasks:**
    *   **(P2) Animated Background:** Implement the animated particle background on the login screen as described in the PRD.
    *   **(P2) Full Responsiveness:** Ensure the application is fully functional and looks good on mobile devices, including a hamburger menu.
    *   **(P3) Evidence Pack Functionality:** Implement the  (PDF/JSON) and  features for the Evidence Packs.

**Completed work in this session**
*   **Project Setup:**
    *   Fixed invalid character error in  name.
    *   Corrected supervisor configuration to run the Vite dev server from the root  directory.
    *   Configured Tailwind CSS by creating .
*   **UI and Feature Updates:**
    *   Replaced placeholder logo with user-provided  in  and all three dashboard components.
    *   Removed the Central de Ajuda button from the  component.
    *   Updated the Vendedores dashboard () based on the PRD.
    *   Updated the Marketplaces dashboard () based on the PRD.
*   **Deployment and Preview:**
    *   Resolved preview issues by updating  in .
    *   Configured  with  to support GitHub Pages.
    *   Created a GitHub Actions workflow at  for automated deployment.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
*   **UI Primitives:** Radix UI
*   **Deployment:** GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions

**key DB schema**
*   N/A (The application is frontend-only)

**changes in tech stack**
*   None

**All files of reference**
*   : To be updated to complete the current task.
*   : Recently updated with PRD features.
*   : Recently updated with PRD features.
*   : Updated with new logo and removed help button.
*   : Updated for GitHub Pages deployment and preview server fixes.
*   : Created to automate deployment.
*   : New asset added by the user.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
*   The entire application uses static, hardcoded data. It will require a complete refactor to integrate with a real backend API.
*   The file  implies an older version exists. Consolidating components would be beneficial.

**key api endpoints**
*   N/A (No backend implemented)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   **Follow the PRD:** The user's message (#166) contains a very detailed PRD. This document is the single source of truth for all UI and feature requirements.
*   **Complete the current task:** The immediate priority is to finish updating the  component and then verify that all three dashboards render correctly with their new features.
*   **Frontend-Only:** Remind yourself that this is a frontend-only project for now. All functionality is purely visual. Do not attempt to implement backend logic unless explicitly asked.
*   **GitHub Pages:** The user is focused on deploying to GitHub Pages. The configuration is done, but the user needs to be reminded to Save to GitHub and set the repository's Pages source to GitHub Actions to trigger the deployment.

**Project Health Check:**
*   **Broken:** GitHub Pages deployment will not work until the user saves the code to the GitHub repository and correctly configures the Pages settings to use GitHub Actions.
*   **Mocked:** The entire application is a mock-up. All data is hardcoded, and no buttons trigger real actions.
